# Beginner JS projects
This is the sequel to the [First Timers Night](https://github.com/womenwhocodedc/front-end-community/blob/master/first-timers-guides/first_timers_javascript_guide.md) for Women Who Code. Each folder contains a sample project that can be worked on, along with the following contents for each project:
* Starter HTML/CSS template files (can be modified for your own project but please give credit)
* Required functionality for the project (aka "To Dos")
* Expected outcomes - screenshots displaying all possible outputs of the given project
* Extra functionality/ideas you can incorporate into the project (aka "Dazzlers")

While all of these projects can be worked on individually, the intent is that any one of these projects will be taught during a front end lab night as a supplement to the first timers nights.
